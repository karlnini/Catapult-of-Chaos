Summon the Chaos Cat! 🐱🔥
Overview
"Summon the Chaos Cat!" is a fun and unpredictable web app where users click a button to trigger one of several random cat-related events. Every click is a surprise—whether it’s a rotating cat image, a random meow sound, or a full-screen cat zoomie. Get ready for some chaos! 😺

How It Works
The app features a big "Summon the Chaos Cat!" button, which you can click as many times as you like.

Every time the button is clicked, one of several random events is triggered, such as:

A cat image appears and slowly rotates 🌀

A cat meowing loudly (random funny sound) 🔊

The entire screen shakes like a cat zoomie 🏃💨

A cat GIF that zooms in aggressively 😂

A fake "error" message that says, "The cat has taken over!"

Every click is different, so you’ll never know what the chaos cat will do next! 🎉
